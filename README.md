# King Attack Module
### Created by Connor Abdelnoor and Kyle Giard-Chase
#### For a project at Epicodus on: </br> May 21 2015

###Purpose

How about some  chess? This module is called King attack. It starts by taking in two sets of coordinates representing a queen and the king trying to escape from her on the opposite side. The module validates all the initial coordinates. Then assume it is the king's turn to move and display another form for the user to input the coordinates to move him to. Then display a message to tell the user if that's a valid move or not. </br>

Here are the rules:

* A king can move only one space but it can be in any direction: up, down, left, right, or diagonally.
* A king cannot move into any space which puts it directly into checkmate.
* When it is the king's turn, he cannot move into a place on the chessboard where in the next turn he will be taken.
